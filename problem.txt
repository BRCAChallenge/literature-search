Neural crest cells migrate along pathways containing laminin and other extracellular matrix molecules. In the present study, we functionally and biochemically identify an alpha 1 beta 1 integrin heterodimer which bears the HNK-1 epitope on neural crest cells. Using a quantitative cell adhesion assay, we find that this heterodimer mediates attachment to laminin substrata prepared in the presence of Ca2+. Interestingly, neural crest cells bind to laminin-Ca2+ substrata in the presence or absence of divalent cations in the cell attachment medium. In contrast, the attachment of neural crest cells to laminin substrata prepared in the presence of EDTA, heparin, Mg2+, or Mn2+ requires divalent cations. Interactions with these laminin substrata are mediated by a different integrin heterodimer, since antibodies against beta 1 but not alpha 1 integrins inhibit neural crest cell attachment. Thus, the type of laminin substratum appears to dictate the choice of laminin receptor used by neural crest cells. The laminin conformation is determined by the ratio of laminin to Ca2+, though incorporation of heparin during substratum polymerization alters the conformation even in the presence of Ca2+. Once polymerized, the substratum appears stable, not being altered by soaking in either EDTA or divalent cations. Our findings demonstrate: (a) that the alpha 1 beta 1 integrin can bind to some forms of laminin in the absence of soluble divalent cations; (b) that substratum preparation conditions alter the conformation of laminin such that plating laminin in the presence of Ca2+ and/or heparin modulates its configuration; and (c) that neural crest cells utilize different integrins to recognize different laminin conformations.	119	5		1280273	2289724		http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1280273	Tue Oct  9 23:54:02 2012		http://jcb.rupress.org/content/119/5/1335.full.pdf?with-ds=yes		1280273.main.html	1280273.main.pdf	
121	As they are transcribed, RNA polymerase II transcripts (hnRNAs or pre-mRNAs) associate with hnRNP proteins and snRNP particles, and the processing of pre-mRNA occurs within these ribonucleoprotein complexes. To better understand the relationship between hnRNP proteins and snRNP particles and their roles in mRNA formation, we have visualized them as they associate with nascent transcripts on the polytene chromosomes of Drosophila melanogaster salivary glands. Simultaneous pairwise detection of the abundant hnRNP proteins hrp36, hrp40, and hrp48 by direct double-label immunofluorescence microscopy reveals all of these proteins are bound to most transcripts, but their relative amounts on different transcripts are not fixed. Numerous differences in the relative amounts of snRNP particles and hnRNP proteins on nascent transcripts are also observed. These observations directly demonstrate that individual hnRNP proteins and snRNP particles are differentially associated with nascent transcripts and suggest that different pre-mRNAs bind different combinations of these factors to form transcript-specific, rather than a single type of, hnRNA-hnRNP-snRNP complexes. The distinct and specific constellation of hnRNP proteins and snRNP particles that assembles on different pre-mRNAs is likely to affect the fate and pathway of processing of these transcripts.		8468343.main.pdf	1993			http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8468343	Association of individual hnRNP proteins and snRNPs with nascent transcripts.	http://jcb.rupress.org/content/121/2/219.full.pdf?with-ds=yes	0375356	medline	PMID8468343	research-article		8468343	2	Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104-6148.
