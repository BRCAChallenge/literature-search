Recently, we identified in two individuals with intellectual disability (ID) different de novo mutations in DEAF1, which encodes a transcription factor with an important role in embryonic development. To ascertain whether these mutations in DEAF1 are causative for the ID phenotype, we performed targeted resequencing of DEAF1 in an additional cohort of over 2,300 individuals with unexplained ID and identified two additional individuals with de novo mutations in this gene. All four individuals had severe ID with severely affected speech development, and three showed severe behavioral problems. DEAF1 is highly expressed in the CNS, especially during early embryonic development. All four mutations were missense mutations affecting the SAND domain of DEAF1. Altered DEAF1 harboring any of the four amino acid changes showed impaired transcriptional regulation of the DEAF1 promoter. Moreover, behavioral studies in mice with a conditional knockout of Deaf1 in the brain showed memory deficits and increased anxiety-like behavior. Our results demonstrate that mutations in DEAF1 cause ID and behavioral problems, most likely as a result of impaired transcriptional regulation by DEAF1.	94	5	649-61	24726472	4067565	10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.03.013	http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929714001153	Sat Mar 12 08:20:38 2016		http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0002929714001153/1-s2.0-S0002929714001153-main.pdf?_tid=5e914186-e86e-11e5-9ed6-00000aab0f02&acdnat=1457799823_ad8e2f184177e6e892808009ded85168			24726472.main.pdf		http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929714001153

Loss-of-function variants in ANKRD11 were identified as the cause of KBG syndrome, an autosomal dominant syndrome with specific dental, neurobehavioural, craniofacial and skeletal anomalies. We present the largest cohort of KBG syndrome cases confirmed by ANKRD11 variants reported so far, consisting of 20 patients from 13 families. Sixteen patients were molecularly diagnosed by Sanger sequencing of ANKRD11, one familial case and three sporadic patients were diagnosed through whole-exome sequencing and one patient was identified through genomewide array analysis. All patients were evaluated by a clinical geneticist. Detailed orofacial phenotyping, including orthodontic evaluation, intra-oral photographs and orthopantomograms, was performed in 10 patients and revealed besides the hallmark feature of macrodontia of central upper incisors, several additional dental anomalies as oligodontia, talon cusps and macrodontia of other teeth. Three-dimensional (3D) stereophotogrammetry was performed in 14 patients and 3D analysis of patients compared with controls showed consistent facial dysmorphisms comprising a bulbous nasal tip, upturned nose with a broad base and a round or triangular face. Many patients exhibited neurobehavioural problems, such as autism spectrum disorder or hyperactivity. One-third of patients presented with (conductive) hearing loss. Congenital heart defects, velopharyngeal insufficiency and hip anomalies were less frequent. On the basis of our observations, we recommend cardiac assessment in children and regular hearing tests in all individuals with a molecular diagnosis of KBG syndrome. As ANKRD11 is a relatively common gene in which sequence variants have been identified in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, it seems an important contributor to the aetiology of both sporadic and familial cases.	23	9	1176-85	25424714	4538199	10.1038/ejhg.2014.253	http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v23/n9/full/ejhg2014253a.html	Sat Mar 12 08:20:45 2016	http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v23/n9/full/ejhg2014253a.html	http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v23/n9/pdf/ejhg2014253a.pdf	http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v23/n9/extref/ejhg2014253x1.doc	25424714.main.html	25424714.main.pdf	25424714.S1.doc	http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v23/n9/full/ejhg2014253a.html
